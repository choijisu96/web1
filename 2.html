      <p>User agents are not required to present HTML documents in any particular way. However, this section provides a set of suggestions for rendering HTML documents that, if followed, are likely to lead to a user experience that closely resembles the experience intended by the documents' authors. So as to avoid confusion regarding the normativity of this section, "must" has not been used. Instead, the term "expected" is used to indicate behavior that will lead to this experience. For the purposes of conformance for user agents designated as supporting the suggested default rendering, the term "expected" in this section has the same conformance implications as "must".</p>
